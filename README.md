# arduino-RFchat
Chat application for Arduino boards and 433MHz transmitter and receiver pair. Uses serial monitor as interface and depends on VirtualWire library


Tested on Arduino Uno and Nano. Uses 433MHz receiver and transmitter pair (http://www.hackerstore.nl/Artikel/99). Most of the functions used are imported from the VirtualWire library (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_VirtualWire.html).
